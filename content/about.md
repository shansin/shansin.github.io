## Hi, I'm Shantanu.

I'm a US-based engineer in Big Tech, currently obsessed with running powerful AI models locally. When I'm not optimizing for VRAM or debugging system errors, I'm likely training for my next endurance event.

### Why This Blog?

- **Learning in Public:** Writing forces clarity. If I can't explain it simply, I don't understand it well enough.
- **The Real Process:** AI content often feels like a highlight reel. I document the messy reality—failed experiments, hardware bottlenecks, and lessons learned.
- **Connection:** Whether you're into local AI, endurance sports, or the intersection of both, let's connect.
